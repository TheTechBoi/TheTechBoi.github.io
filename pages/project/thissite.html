                <h2>Welcome!</h2>

                <div class="paragSec">
                    <p> &nbsp; On this page, I described "How I Made This Simple Website". 
                        First of all, I want to explain to you why rather than how.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why?</h2>

                <div class="paragSec">
                    <p> &nbsp; I'm a person who really likes sharing knowledge and motivating people who have 
                        an interest in robotics, programming, etc. One day I came with an idea;
                        Making a blog-like website where I can share my hobby-work (tech stuff). 
                        So, in the short term, I made it for helping others and a bit for motivating my self.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>How?</h2>

                <div class="paragSec">
                    <p> &nbsp; When I decided to do it, I needed to learn some important things. 
                        Like how to make a website? 
                        So I jumped on youtube to find some tutorials. 
                        I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABDU532eesybur5HPBVfC1G">this</a> tutorial.
                        While I was following the tutorial i kept googling things that didn't make up in my mind. 
                        I finished the tutorial, nice but now what? 
                        I opened photoshop and made some page samples, then I "coded" it. 
                        "Oops, I don't know how I can make this element, okey it's google time!". 
                        While I was searching a tutorial, found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers">this</a> channel
                        and I learned a lot of new design strategies and elements from it. 
                        It was looking good but there were still some problems. 
                        "OnlineTutorials"s tutorials were good but they weren't so clear and 
                        understandable so I ended up with an another google time 
                        and used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">this</a> website. 
                        Another problem was this: I COULDN'T CENTER ELEMENTS. 
                        Solution: display:grid + place-items:center (found in <a href="https://youtu.be/qm0IfG1GyZU">here</a>).
                        The website was done but domain&hosting wasn't. For this, thank you <a href="github.io">github.io</a>. 
                        It's a hosting service from GitHub and it is very simple to use.
